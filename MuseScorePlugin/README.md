# Installation requirements
- Install Magenta
- Install Flask
- Install flask-cors
- Install music21

Those steps are required in the server machine, the client just requires MuseScore 3.x

## How to use
- Run flask_server.py in the server (can be the local machine).
- Put coconet.qml in MuseScore's Plugin Directory and load it from MuseScore.
- Input the server address and push the "Harmonize" button after selecting the desired melody to harmonize.
