	abstract = {We address the problem of automatically harmonizing a leadsheet in the style of any arranger. We model the arranging style as a Markov model estimated from a corpus of non-annotated {MIDI} files. We consider a vertical approach to harmonization, in which chords are all taken from the arranger corpus. We show that standard Markov models, using various vertical viewpoints are not adapted for such a task, because the problem is basically over constrained. We propose the concept of fioriture to better capture the subtleties of an arranging style. Fioritures are ornaments of the given melody during which the arranging style can be expressed more freely than for melody notes. Fioritures are defined as random walks with unary constraints and can be implemented with the technique of Markov constraints. We claim that fioritures lead to musically more interesting harmonizations than previous approaches and discuss why. We focus on the style of Take 6, arguably the most sophisticated arranging style in the jazz genre, and we demonstrate the validity of our approach by harmonizing a large corpus of standard leadsheets.},

	abstract = {Performance {RNN} is a machine-learning system designed primarily for the generation of solo piano performances using an event-based (rather than audio) representation. More specifically, Performance {RNN} is a long short-term memory ({LSTM}) based recurrent neural network that models polyphonic music with expressive timing and dynamics (Oore et al., 2018). The neural network uses a simple language model based on the Musical Instrument Digital Interface ({MIDI}) file format. Performance {RNN} is trained on the e-Piano Junior Competition Dataset (International Piano e-Competition, 2018), a collection of solo piano performances by expert pianists. As an artistic tool, one of the limitations of the original model has been the lack of useable controls. The standard form of Performance {RNN} can generate interesting pieces, but little control is provided over what specifically is generated. This paper explores a set of conditioning-based controls used to influence the generation process.},

The system contains about 350 rules, written in a form of first-order predicate calculus. The rules represent musical knowledge from multiple viewpoints of the chorale, such as the chord skeleton, the melodic lines of the individual parts, and Schenkerian voice leading within the descant and bass. The program harmonizes chorale melodies using a generate-and-test method with intelligent backtracking. A substantial number of heuristics are used for biasing the search toward musical solutions. The CHORAL knowledge base provides for style-specific modulations, cadence patterns, and complex encounters of simultaneous inessential notes; it imposes difficult constraints for maintaining melodic interest in the inner voices. Encouraging results have been obtained, and output examples are given. BSL, a new and efficient logic-programming language fundamentally different from PROLOG, was designed to implement the CHORAL system.},

This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score.

	abstract = {Machine learning models of music typically break up the task of composition into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. In order to better approximate this process, we train a convolutional neural network to complete partial musical scores, and explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to rewriting. Neither the model nor the generative procedure are tied to a particular causal direction of composition. Our model is an instance of orderless NADE (Uria et al., 2014), which allows more direct ancestral sampling. However, we find that Gibbs sampling greatly improves sample quality, which we demonstrate to be due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al. (2014) yields better samples than ancestral sampling, based on both log-likelihood and human evaluation.},

In this work we introduce an efficient procedure to simultaneously train a NADE model for each possible ordering of the variables, by sharing parameters across all these models. We can thus use the most convenient model for each inference task at hand, and ensembles of such models with different orderings are immediately available.

By doing this, we obtain a predictive update version of the Gibbs sampler. A procedure of calculating the posterior odds ratio via the collapsed Gibbs sampler when incomplete observations are involved is presented.

	abstract = {Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimators (NADEs) have recently been shown as successful alternatives for modeling high dimensional multimodal distributions. One issue associated with NADEs is that they rely on a particular order of factorization for \$P({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\})\$. This issue has been recently addressed by a variant of NADE called Orderless NADEs and its deeper version, Deep Orderless NADE. Orderless NADEs are trained based on a criterion that stochastically maximizes \$P({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\})\$ with all possible orders of factorizations. Unfortunately, ancestral sampling from deep NADE is very expensive, corresponding to running through a neural net separately predicting each of the visible variables given some others. This work makes a connection between this criterion and the training criterion for Generative Stochastic Networks (GSNs). It shows that training NADEs in this way also trains a GSN, which defines a Markov chain associated with the NADE model. Based on this connection, we show an alternative way to sample from a trained Orderless NADE that allows to trade-off computing time and quality of the samples: a 3 to 10-fold speedup (taking into account the waste due to correlations between consecutive samples of the chain) can be obtained without noticeably reducing the quality of the samples. This is achieved using a novel sampling procedure for GSNs called annealed GSN sampling, similar to tempering methods that combines fast mixing (obtained thanks to steps at high noise levels) with accurate samples (obtained thanks to steps at low noise levels).},

Drawing on an innovative approach called "computational" psychology, Boden outlines the thought process and mental structures in which our creativity is grounded. She examines how the unconscious devises novel associations, how we learn to form new analogies, and how we come to break out of familiar conceptual frameworks in order to produce a creative idea. With examples ranging from story writing to chess to physics, from jazz improvisation to the diagnosis of soybean disease, she explains how all forms of creativity spring from the same cognitive devices and mental maps, demonstrating how the average person's creativity is related to that of Mozart or a Shakespeare.

	abstract = {This essay discusses whether computers, using Artificial Intelligence (AI), could create art. First, the history of technologies that automated aspects of art is surveyed, including photography and animation. In each case, there were initial fears and denial of the technology, followed by a blossoming of new creative and professional opportunities for artists. The current hype and reality of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools for art making is then discussed, together with predictions about how AI tools will be used. It is then speculated about whether it could ever happen that AI systems could be credited with authorship of artwork. It is theorized that art is something created by social agents, and so computers cannot be credited with authorship of art in our current understanding. A few ways that this could change are also hypothesized.},

	abstract = {The computational creativity community (rightfully) takes a dim view of supposedly creative systems that operate by mere generation. However, what exactly this means has never been adequately deﬁned, and therefore the idea of requiring systems to exceed this standard is problematic. Here, we revisit the question of mere generation and attempt to qualitatively identify what constitutes exceeding this threshold. This exercise leads to the conclusion that the question is likely no longer relevant for the ﬁeld and that a failure to recognize this is likely detrimental to its future health.},
